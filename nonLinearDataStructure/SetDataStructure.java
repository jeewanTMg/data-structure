    * HashSet in Java implements the Set interface of Collections Framework.

    * specific order of elements.Can store the Null values.
      Uses HashMap (implementation of hash table data structure) internally.
      Also implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
     HashSet is not thread-safe. So to make it thread-safe, synchronization needed externally.
